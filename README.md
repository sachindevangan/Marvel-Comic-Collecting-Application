# Marvel Comic Collecting Application

## Description
This project is a React-based Marvel Comic collecting application that uses the Marvel API to retrieve and display data about Marvel comics. The application is built with Express, Redis, and either Redux or the Context API to handle comic collection management, caching, and state management. It enables users to browse, collect, and manage various sub-collections of comics, all while optimizing data fetching with Redis caching.

## Features
- **Homepage**: Introduces the purpose of the application.
- **Comic List Page**: Displays a paginated list of Marvel comics. Users can navigate pages, view comic details, and add/remove comics from collections.
- **Comic Details Page**: Shows detailed information about a single comic, including title, image, description, sale date, and price.
- **Collection Management**: Allows users to create sub-collections, add comics to a selected sub-collection, and manage comics within each collection.
- **Pagination**: Users can navigate comics using previous/next buttons, with visibility based on the current page.
- **Caching**: Uses Redis to cache API responses, improving performance by reducing redundant requests.
- **State Persistence**: Optionally, the application can use Redux-persist for maintaining state across page reloads.
- **Error Handling**: Redirects to 404 pages when resources are unavailable.

## Tech Stack
- React
- Express
- Redis
- Redux or Context API
- Axios
- Material-UI

## API Endpoints (Server)
1. **/api/comics/page/:pagenum**: Returns a paginated list of comics from the Marvel API, with caching.
2. **/api/comics/:id**: Provides detailed data for a specific comic by ID, using cache if available.

## Routes (Frontend)
- **`/`**: Homepage.
- **`/marvel-comics/page/:pagenum`**: Comic listing with pagination.
- **`/marvel-comics/:id`**: Displays detailed information for a specific comic.
- **`/marvel-comics/collections`**: Shows all sub-collections and their comics, with options to manage them.

3. Install dependencies.
   ```bash
